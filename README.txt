Some Problems I faced: 
1. Queues implementation - I tried multiple approaches like LinkedList and array in both c and c++ but I couldn't
                           implement the dequeue functionality right. While in conversation with a classmate - 
                           Chanpreet Singh who was struggling with the same issue, we tried multiple google 
                           searches and could finally find something that made sense and worked at 
                           https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-set-1introduction-and-array-implementation/
                           The code for queue implementation was adapted from this website and was modified 
                           according to string implementation. 

2. Semaphores - I am not sure if I could completely test my semaphores functionality

3. For finding the time and size of the queue at any instant of the program
